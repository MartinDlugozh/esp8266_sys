# Library for the **MAX44009** - the ambient light sensor

## Configuration

Library have a signle configuration definition - `MAX44009_ACCURACY`. In case when it defined as `0`, library will be compiled with the reduced accuracy. That means for Lux readings will be used single I2C transaction and a little less calculations will be made in cost of losing some precision in results. Eny other (non-zero) value will compile normal accuracy. 

## Usage

Include library, initialize I2C and then call `MAX44009_GetLux()` function to get Lux readings. The return of this function is the LUX value, measured in `millilux` (e.g. the value of `147520` represents `147.520` Lux).

## Porting

This library uses only two hardware-dependent functions: `MAX44009_WriteReg()` and `MAX44009_ReadReg()` which communicates with the IC via I2C bus.

`MAX44009_WriteReg()` - writes a value to register of MAX44009. It should be able to transmit two bytes via I2C and then generate a STOP condition.

`MAX44009_ReadReg()` - reads a value of register of MAX44009. It should be able transmit a single byte via I2C, reads a single byte via I2C and then generate a STOP condition.

## Usage with multiple sensors

Two sensors can be used ta the same time with different logic levels on A0. Pull A0 low on the first sensor and high on the second sensor. Use addresses defined: `MAX44009_ADDR_1` (`MAX44009_A0_LOW`) and `MAX44009_ADDR_2` (`MAX44009_A0_HIGH`).
